`m3e-dialog-trigger` (attribute `for`: the dialog's id) goes inside a button and opens the dialog when the button is clicked. `m3e-dialog-action` (attribute `return-value`) goes inside a button in the dialog; clicking it closes the dialog and returns that value.

## Customizing the look

The `--m3e-card-*` variables control the card's corner radius, color and padding. For example, `--m3e-card-shape` is the corner radius:

```html
<m3e-card variant="outlined" style="--m3e-card-shape: 28px;">…</m3e-card>
```

The theme's `m3e.ts` registers the components (`@m3e/web/card`, `@m3e/web/dialog`).
